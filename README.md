# Project Priority Matrix

This repository contains a project priority matrix used for evaluating and prioritizing key initiatives. The matrix assesses projects across three dimensions: **Feasibility**, **Impact**, and **Size**. 

---

## üîç Project Map
The following projects are included in this assessment:
- `sensor`
- `as_operation`
- `Project 777`
- `site exp`
- `displayed integration`
- `digital vk`

---

## üìä Evaluation Matrix
Projects are scored on a numerical scale (0-10) for each criterion:
- **Feasibility**: Likelihood of successful implementation (Higher = more feasible).
- **Impact**: Expected business/value impact (Higher = greater impact).
- **Size**: Estimated effort/resource requirements (Higher = larger effort).

### üîë Key Observations
1. **Highest Impact**: `project map` (Impact = 9).
2. **Highest Feasibility**: `Project vk` (Feasibility = 9).
3. **Lowest Effort**: `site exp` (Size = 2).
4. **Lowest Impact**: `Project vk` (Impact = 0) ‚Äì warrants review.

## üí° How to Use This Matrix
1. **Prioritization**:  
   Combine scores (e.g., `Impact / Size` or `(Impact + Feasibility) - Size`) to rank projects.
2. **Risk Analysis**:  
   Low feasibility + High impact = High-risk projects needing mitigation.
3. **Quick Wins**:  
   Target high-impact, low-effort projects (e.g., `site exp`).
4. **Alignment**:  
   Cross-reference with the [Project Map](#-project-map) for context.
